## 📖 Project Overview

This project addresses a fundamental challenge in **Auditory Attention Decoding (AAD)**: effectively disentangling attended speech from raw Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals.

Traditional AAD approaches often overlook key neuroscience priors:

- The brain’s hierarchical auditory processing mechanism  
- The temporal delay and asynchrony between acoustic input and neural responses  
- The interference from unattended competing speech encoded in EEG  

Ignoring these priors leads to limited decoding performance and reduced interpretability.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a **neuroscience-guided EEGViT framework** integrating hierarchical modeling, contrastive learning, and mutual information minimization.

## 🧠 Core Contributions

### 1️⃣ EEGViT

A Vision Transformer-inspired architecture designed for EEG modeling.

- Processes EEG signals as temporal patches  
- Mimics hierarchical auditory processing in the cortex  
- Learns multi-scale temporal representations  

---

### 2️⃣ Hierarchical Contrastive Learning (HCL)

- Aligns EEG embeddings with:
  - Attended speech embeddings  
  - Unattended speech embeddings  
- Speech features are extracted using WavLM  
- Supports multi-negative contrastive objectives  

---

### 3️⃣ Hierarchical Mutual Information Minimization (HMIM)

- Explicitly suppresses unattended speech information  
- Encourages disentangled neural representations  
- Improves robustness and interpretability  

---

## 📊 Datasets

We validate our framework on three public AAD datasets:

- KUL Dataset  
- DTU Dataset  
- NJU Dataset  

The proposed framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while producing neuroscientifically interpretable representations.
